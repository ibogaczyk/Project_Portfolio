## Description
The overall objective of this project was to illustrate individual growth over the course of the past 15 weeks to display my work utilizing Github Desktop and Visual Studio Code. I found a one-page template using Bootstrap and edited the code to fit my specifications as well as created new pages needed to satisfy requirements such as terms & conditions, privacy policy, and cookies policy.

## What did I learn?
I learned that there are many more elements that go into a simple webpage than I initially expected. Adding things such as a favicon can make all the difference between a website looking generic versus put together. It was nice being able to include my own touches and be creative with the way I wanted it to look even though I used a template. Using Github Desktop made it very easy for me to look back on my previous work and benchmark my progress as this spanned over a few weeks. I also learned that creating pages such as a privacy policy is important as data collection is utilized wherever you go online and users appreiciate transparency.
